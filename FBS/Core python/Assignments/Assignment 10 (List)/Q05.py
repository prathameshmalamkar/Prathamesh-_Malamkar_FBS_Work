def is_present(li,ele):
    count=0
    if ele in li:
        for i in li:
            if ele == i:
                count += 1
                
        print(f"it is present in given list {count} times")
    else:
        print("it is not present in given list")  
        
li=[20,10,20,30,50,40,70,10]

is_present(li,20)
