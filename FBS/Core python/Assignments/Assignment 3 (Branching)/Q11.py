#### Q11. Accept age of five people and also per person ticket amount and then calculate total
# amount to ticket to travel for all of them based on following condition :
# a. Children below 12 = 30% discount
# b. Senior citizen (above 59) = 50% discount
# c. Others need to pay full.

# lets accept ticket price first:

T_price_p4=float(input("Enter ticket price of person 4:")) 
T_price_p5=float(input("Enter ticket price of person 5:"))

# lets take total amt of ticket for 5 person is 0:
total_amt=0
