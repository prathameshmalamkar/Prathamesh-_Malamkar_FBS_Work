feet=float(input("Enter distance in feet:"))
inches=float(input("Enter distance in inches:"))

#lets covert feet and inches into only inches.
total_inches=(feet*12)+inches

# lets covert inches into centimeter. where,1 inch=2.54 cm
total_cm=total_inches*2.54

#lets covert centimeter into meter.where,1m=100cm so we have to divide total cm by 100 to get meter.
total_m=total_cm/100

#lets display the output.
