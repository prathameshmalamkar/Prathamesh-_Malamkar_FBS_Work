# D = [2000, 500, 200, 100 , 50, 20, 10, 5]
# Accept an amount from user and calculate how many
# minimum number of notes will be needed for that
# amount.

D = [2000, 500, 200, 100 , 50, 20, 10, 5]

amount =int(input("enter the amount:"))
total_notes =0
for note in D:
    count =amount // note

    if(count >0):
        print(f"{note} : {count} ")

    total_notes =total_notes +count
    amount = amount % note

print("minimum no of notes:",total_notes)
